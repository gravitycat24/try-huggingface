After taking office he built a reputation around himself, but his presidency also provided him with a strong base of support from the public, and through him came some of the most consequential moments in American political history.\\n\\nHere are some highlights of his Presidency from the campaign:\\n\\nIn August 1993 Clinton became the first President since John F. Kennedy to lead the UN to become the first nation in the world to get the State Department to sign off on the deal to build Gaza.\\n\\nClinton brought back the Environmental Protection Agency.\\n\\nClinton set a record on the environment. He set the US carbon tax in the most expensive place in history.\\n\\nClinton broke the international climate record at the UN by setting a record setting global carbon emissions.\\n\\nThe US ended World War II with the deployment of 100,000 troops in Vietnam.\\n\\nClinton helped build the first coal-fired power plant outside the United States.\\n\\nClinton\\'s first 100 days as President of the United States were marred by an economic decline of 11,500 jobs and an economic recession of 7,500 jobs. President Obama, meanwhile, was seen as both a \"progressive\" and a risk to the U.S. economy.\\n\\nThe presidency also changed the direction of the world\\'s economy. It opened the door to China\\'s economic expansion and helped pave the way for China to enter the new world economy of the 21st Century.\\n\\nTrump, in an interview shortly after his campaign began, said he would \"cut taxes... I have to cut it.\"\\n\\nDespite his early success in the White House, Republicans, many of whom didn\\'t vote for him, wanted him out in the general election.\\n\\nWhat did Trump have in store for that Democrat who is running for president, Bernie Sanders? It should be clear to anyone who has ever met Trump that he is not a leader. His actions speak louder today. It doesn\\'t matter if you\\'re one of his most vocal supporters or a friend. He should be taken seriously, but not silenced.\\n\\nTrump has won over the American people. They are deeply grateful.\\n\\nThe American people want President-elect Trump to be President of the United States. It will never be easy to take office. But the message is clear. Don\\'t let Trump down.\\n\\nWatch Fox and Friends News for all the latest news on'}]"
